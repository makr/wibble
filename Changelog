**2010-12-18 - State dicts, coroutine helpers, fixed zone handler order**

Release version: [http://wiki.tcl.tk/_/revision?N=27377.code&V=17];

Announcement: [http://wiki.tcl.tk/27383#pagetocab50d82b]

AMG: I changed the zone handler arguments, so any existing zone handlers will have to be rewritten.  I hope this new method works better than the fixed request/response approach I had before.  Also, I changed the way the [coroutine]s [yield] and are resumed; this should make AJAX work better.  (Yes, Wibble supports AJAX!)

* Cutesy CSS changes in [vars].
* Update all zone handlers to receive a unified state dict instead of request and response dicts.
* Update [vars] to display all sub-dicts in $state.
* Pointless wording, capitalization, comment, and indentation changes.
* Fix [dumprequest] to format query the same as post.
* Write [resume] and [suspend] as wrappers around reinvoking the coroutine and [yield].
* Remove [chan names] testing code since it didn't work anyway.
* Update [getline] and [getblock] to use [suspend].
* Rename $zones to $zonehandlers.
* Change $zonehandlers to be a flat list instead of a dict.
* Rewrite [getresponse] to use state dictionaries instead of request/response pairs.
* Don't merge options into the request dict; instead make a separate options dict in $state.
* Fix zone order handling in [getresponse].
* Fix a subtle bug in [getresponse] that can make it replace the wrong state entry in $system.
* Update the [chan copy] code to use [resume] and [suspend].
* Don't install the [chan event] handler in [listen] since it'll be installed by [suspend].


**2010-11-13 - Non-blocking file transfers, bug workarounds**

Announcement: [http://wiki.tcl.tk/27383#pagetoc8a441aa4]

AMG: Sorry about the blocking [chan copy].  It's fixed now.

* Don't initialize $wibble::zones to empty string.  This makes it easier to re-[source] wibble.tcl while it's running.
* Remove some extra [chan close]s.  The channel will be closed anyway by the finally clause at the end of [process].
* Add workaround for the Wiki bug that was corrupting [enhtml] and [enattr] (see [http://wiki.tcl.tk/27382#pagetoc5da162fc]).
* Remove the question mark from [enquery] to make it mirror [dequery]
* Make [chan copy] be non-blocking.
* Add workaround for the "command returned bad code: 2" Tcl bug (see [http://wiki.tcl.tk/27382#pagetoc640ac485]).
* Spell out "peerhost" and "peerport".
* Re-fix the [namespace code] in [accept] (see [http://wiki.tcl.tk/27382#pagetoca290566b]).


**2010-11-07 - Separate templates and scripts, improved request dictionary reporting**

Announcement: [http://wiki.tcl.tk/27383#pagetoc40fc9a27]

AMG: Now that I've finished reorganizing all the Wibble pages, I'm eager to edit them some more! :^)

* Write [dumprequest] to partially "flatten" a request dictionary to make it easier to display.
* Make the output of the vars zone handler much nicer.
* Make the error log nicer too.
* Split the template zone handler into two pieces:
** [template]: Compile *.tmpl files into *.script files.
** [script]: Execute *.script files.
* Add rawtime, time, and port to the request dictionary.
* Completely remove PUT.
* Slightly simplify POST handling.
* Replace [dict for] with [foreach] to support duplicate keys.
* Improve the failsafe ![[info exists] $request] error log.
* Remove -nonewline option from [log].
* Move \n from the end to the beginning of the line.
* Add new script zone handler to example code.
* Remove special logging of the never-implemented "content" key in the request dictionary.
* Remove [accept] and changed [listen] to use [apply].


**2010-11-06 - Header and POST parsing**

Release version: [http://wiki.tcl.tk/_/revision?N=27377.code&V=4];

Word differences: [http://wiki.tcl.tk/_/diff?N=27377&V=4&D=0&W=1];
Announcement: [http://wiki.tcl.tk/27383#pagetoc7f4ca42f]

AMG: I've been holding on to these changes for far too long, and I'm glad to finally publish them.

* Add separator comments delimiting major sections of the code.
* Change usage of [[[dict with] request]] to cut down on indenting.
* Add many conversion routines:
** [enhtml]: Encode for HTML.
** [enattr]: Encode for HTML tag attribute.
** [enpre]: Encode for HTML <pre>.
** [enquery]: Encode a query string.
** [dequery]: Decode a query string into a list.
** [enhex]: Encode most non-alphanumerics with hexadecimal codes.
** [dehex]: Decode hexadecimal encoding.
** [enurl]: Encode for URLs.
** [deurl]: Decode URL encoding.
** [delist]: Decode header list encoding.
** [dequote]: Decode header quoting.
** [deheader]: Decode HTTP headers.  (!!!)
* Actually, [dehex] already existed, named [unhex].  Rename because [enhex] and [unhex] are too similar.
* Modify zone handlers to use new conversion routines, e.g. [enhtml].
* Replace <td><b> with <th> in [vars].
* Simplify the way [dirlist] adds .. to the directory listing.
* Change [applytemplate] to [compiletemplate], which returns the script instead of running it.
* Make [template] cache the result of [compiletemplate].
* Simplify [append]'s arguments in [compiletemplate].
* Add [channel] closure detection to [getline] and [getblock].
* Revert second-chance [chan gets] in [getline], since I'm not convinced it's necessary (see [http://wiki.tcl.tk/27382#pagetoc3c65f636]).
* Change the way [nexthandler] and [sendresponse] pass control back to [getresponse].
* Add accept, post, and rawpost to the request dictionary.
* Add Accept*: header handling.
* Add POST handling.
* [Unset] request dictionary after sending the response to avoid stale data.
* Correct error report charset.
* Incorporate APN's [accept] fix (see [http://wiki.tcl.tk/27382#pagetoc8c99f371]).

The channel closure detection makes it possible to close connections due to timeouts.  This isn't implemented yet, but it would be nice to harden Wibble against basic DoS attacks.
