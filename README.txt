Wibble Web Server

Wibble is a small, pure-Tcl web server inspired by Wub, DustMote, Coronet, and Templates and subst.

It is written and maintained by Andy Goth.

See http://wiki.tcl.tk/wibble for the current version, documentation, examples, etc.

This repository is unofficial and just tracking some changes done on the wiki!

Another unofficial repository can be found at https://github.com/jcowgar/wibble.git - where they seem to have added some more functionality.
